## The notebooks are to be viewed in the following sequence: 

### 1. Data Collection - API
This noteook leverages on the various APIs provided by SpaceX to retrieve launch information, initial data wrangling was also conducted here to deal with some missing Data. 

### 2. Data Collection - Webscraping
This noteook collects launch data from Wikipedia tables leveraging on BeautifulSoup to conduct webscraping for relevant data.

### 3. Data Wrangling - EDA
This noteook conducts basic exploratory data analysis, exploring the data types and statistics of the gathered data to understand the data better.

### 4. Data Wrangling - EDA with Visualization
This noteook visualizes the gathered data via charts (scatterplots and barcharts) and provides a visual representation on the various inter-columns relationships.

### 5. Data Wrangling - EDA with SQL
This noteook conducts exploratory data analysis via SQL

### 6. Data Wrangling - Interactive Visualiation
This noteook conducts exploratory data analysis using geospatial data and folium maps.

### 7. Dashboarding with Plotly
The folder provides a dashboard which acts as an interactive platform for data visualization

### 8. Prediction - Model Building
The noteook trains and evaluates various models to fit the data set, finding the optimal parameters and scores to determine the best model for classification.
